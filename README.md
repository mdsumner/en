# UTM to Lat/Lon Converter

## Purpose
The UTM to Lat/Lon Converter is a web-based tool that allows users to convert UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates into latitude and longitude coordinates. This tool is useful for anyone working with geographical data that requires transformation between these two coordinate systems.

## How to Use
1. Open the `utm-to-latlon.html` web page in your browser.
2. Enter the UTM coordinates (Easting and Northing) in the provided fields.
3. Select the appropriate zone for the UTM coordinates.
4. Click on the "Convert" button to see the corresponding latitude and longitude values.

## Requirements
- An active internet connection is required to use the converter as it relies on the proj4js library for coordinate transformations.

## Example Usage
- Input your UTM coordinates, and the tool will display the converted latitude and longitude in real-time.
